                        <h3 class="mt-4 mb-3 fs-5 fw-bold text-center mt-3 custom-black-text">Abu Abdulloh Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi</h3>
                        <p>Muhammad al-Khorazmi is a scientist who made an invaluable contribution to world science with his genius discoveries. Taking into account that he was invited to the palace of Ma'mun ibn Harun al-Rashid, the governor of Khurasan in Baghdad, in the early 800s, he studied in his native Khorezm and became a famous scholar in his twenties. In 813, Mamun took the caliphate crown and moved to Baghdad with the scholars gathered in Marw. A great lover of science, Ma'mun founded "Bayt al-hikma" ("House of Wisdom"), which is called "Baghdad Academy" in the history of science. Muhammad al-Khorazmi was the director of this scientific center until the end of his life. Many scientists from the Arab East and countries of Central Asia worked here. A library full of ancient manuscripts and a specially built observatory served them.</p>
                        <p>Muhammad al-Khorazmi was the author of more than 20 scientific works, 7 of which have survived to our time. Including:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li class="mb-2">"Fi hisab al-Hind" (Arabic "Book on Indian calculation") is a work representing the decimal positional counting system and describing nine numbers with a zero sign.</li>
                            <li class="mb-2">"Al-kitab al-mukhtasar fi hisab al-jabr wa al-muqabala". (A short book on Al-Jabr and Al-Muqabala calculus, written in Arabic) - a book called "Algebra" by the author, considering algebra as a science.</li>
                            <li class="mb-2">Ziji al-Khwarazmi (written in Arabic ("Zij") "Astronomical table") is a work consisting of a small theoretical section and tables containing the trigonometric functions of sines.</li>
                            <li class="mb-2">"Kitab surat al-arz" (written in Arabic "The book of the picture of the Earth") is a geographical treatise containing a map of the eastern half of the planet Earth, the countries on it, the Pacific Ocean (Bahr al-muzallam) and the map of our planet for the first time in the Middle Ages.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Muhammad al-Khorazmi's important contribution to the sciences of mathematics, astronomy and geography, and through them to the development of civilization:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li class="mb-2">He founded the number system representing nine digits with a zero sign, which represents the decimal positional calculation.</li>
                            <li class="mb-2">He created algebra as a science and gave it that name.</li>
                            <li class="mb-2">He developed a new method of scientific and educational works through clear and understandable rules, called "Algorithm" in European literature, and launched them. In Latin, the pronunciation of "algorithm" is equivalent to his name - al-Khwarizmi. This concept of algorithm forms the basis of all modern digital information and computer technologies. It is through this method that the description of Muhammad al-Khwarazmi's works has spread to the general public. In addition to the aforementioned services, it is now known that he used pole points.</li>
                            <li class="mb-2">The Astronomical book of Muhammad al-Khorazmi ("Ziji") deals with the Sun, the Moon, the five planets, mathematical geography, trigonometry, and eclipses of the Sun and the Moon. The book was translated into Latin in 1126, German in 1914, and English in 1962.</li>
                            <li class="mb-2">Muhammad al-Khorazmi's geographical works describe the known places on earth at that time. In the work, the places are presented with a clear map, the rivers, seas and oceans there, and a significant population of 2402. It was the first geographical work in Arabic written in the Middle Ages. This climate theory played an important role in the development of geography.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Muhammad al-Khwarizmi's contribution to the development of mathematics and civilization, in general, is recognized, his name is stamped on "algorithm" and the term "algorithm" in one of his works is proof of his uniqueness among Eastern scientists. "The greatest mathematician of his time, by all accounts one of the greatest scientists of all time" was given by the American historian Dj.Sarton</p>

                        <h3 class="mt-4 mb-3 fs-5 fw-bold text-center mt-3 custom-black-text">Mirzo Ulug‘bek</h3>
                        <p>Ulugbek (Muhammad Taragay) was born on March 22, 1394, in Sultonia, in the territory of present-day Azerbaijan. Ulugbek received an excellent education, as opposed to the measure of those times. A remarkable memory holder, he was fluent in Arabic and Persian, was well-versed in Turkish poetry, possessed literary styles, and participated in literary debates. 1417–1420: Ulugbek built a madrasa in Samarkand, becoming the first architectural ensemble erected in Registan. To this madrasa, Ulugbek offers many astronomers and mathematicians from the Islamic world. But Ulughbeck's great passion was Astronomy. The meaning of Ulughbek's life and the astronomer follower-scientists such as Kazizoda Rumiy, Jamshid Ghiyosiddin al Koshiy, and Ali Qushchi were the impetus for the construction of the Observatory.</p>
                        <p>Research scientists believe that the construction of the observatory was completed by 1428–1429. The observatory was a rare building of its time. To withstand the shaking of the earth, the stone hem of Qohak Hill was chosen for the construction of the building. The main instrument is the sextant (angle gauge) - designed from south to north along meridian lines. In addition to the main instrument, there were other astronomical instruments in the Observatory.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps the reason for making accurate astronomical observations was the size of the sextant, its convenient structure, Ulughbek's knowledge, and his partner. With the guidance and participation of the great astronomer Ulugbek, the main work of the observatory was the compilation of “Zidzhiy Karagani”, and “Ulugbek's star chart”. The book marks the first time that 1018 star positions from this Samarkand Observatory have been determined in incredible accuracy, following Hipparchus. The creation of the astronomical series is a huge contribution to the treasury of world astronomical science. Ulugbek repeatedly checks his data and concludes that his numbers are correct. In 1437 years, he determines the length of the astronomical year: 365 days, 6 hours, 10 minutes, and 8 seconds. Later, it was clear that the difference in changes was in 58 seconds. If you take into account that the length of the astronomical year is 31 million 558 thousand 150 seconds, you can be sure of the high accuracy with which Ulugbek carried its dimensions. The 1018 constellations that Ulugbek calculated serve as a compass for astronomers and historians studying ancient chronologies. Ulugbek's star chart confirms the authenticity of Ptolemy's star map, as listed in the ”Almagest".</p>
                        <p>In 1648, Ulugbek's main work on the famous Samarkand observatory was published for the first time in Oxford, one of the oldest centres of science and culture in England. John Greaves (1602–1652), professor of astronomy at Oxford University, prepared the work for publication and wrote a commentary on it. Later, series plates were published several times in England.</p>
                        <p>17 years after the first Oxford edition, Thomas Hyde (1636–1703), a scholar, keeper of the Bodleian Library in Oxford, English orientalist, and translator, prepared the Samarkand edition for a new edition in Persian and Latin, "Tabulae Long, as Lat. Stellarum Fixarum, ex observatione Ulugh Beighi”, published under the title Oxonii, 1665.</p>
                        <p>The publication of Ulugbek's Tables in Europe, where a unique catalogue of stars, which required enormous and laborious observational and computational labour to compile, was calculated by a few individuals and highly valued by sky explorers.</p>
                        <p>25 years after Hyde's Oxford edition, information on Ulugbek's table appears in the pages of the book "Prodromus Astronomiae" published in Gdańsk by the Polish astronomer Jan Hevely (1611-1687). Here is a comparison between the data from the collections available at the time: Ptolemy, Tycho Bragg, Riccioli, Prince Gass, and Hevelius.</p>
                        <p>In 1839, the French orientalist L.A. Sedio (1808–1876) partially published Ulugbek's table under the title "Tables astronomigue d'Oloug Beg, commentees et publiees avec le texte en regard", chapter I, section I, Paris, 1839.</p>
                        <p>And, finally, a more accurate analysis of Ulugh Beg's table based on the study of 8 manuscripts stored in British libraries was published in 1917 in the USA by E. B. Noble, "Ulugh Beg's Catalog of Stars. Published under the name Revised from all Persian Manuscripts Existing in Great Britain.</p>
                        <p>It is worth mentioning that there are dozens of manuscripts of "Zidzhi" in European and Asian book storage warehouses. Ulugbek's table of stars became the last word of medieval astronomy. This table was the highest point of medieval astronomy before the invention of the telescope.</p>
                        <p>Ulugbek's rich scientific legacy confirms that he was not only the son of a great Muslim. The genius of creative thinking has made an invaluable contribution to the development of science and civilization for all mankind. Therefore, many centuries later, even today, the name of Ulugbek remains a symbol that unites the peoples of the East and the West intending to achieve meritorious goals.</p>
                        <p>Mirzo Ulugbek's high spiritual and tangible heritage is studied in the world's leading educational institutions and scientific centres. On the initiative of the First President of the Republic of Uzbekistan Islam Karimov, the fact that the National University of Uzbekistan was named in honour of this famous scientist confirms the high scientific and spiritual power of the republic today.</p>
